# french
A SAT solver using simulated annealing in OxCaml.

## Build
You need `dune` to build this project.
I use OxCaml toolkit, however it should be buildable on usual 5.0+ Ocaml as I do not currently utilize any OxCaml features.

You can build the executable with `dune build`.

## Run
Currently there is a simple test executable that you can run with `dune exec french`.
